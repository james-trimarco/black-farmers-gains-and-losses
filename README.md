Mapping Gains and Losses of Black Farmers by U.S. County

For this project, my team saw that the United States had gained about 3,700 African American farmers between the Agricultural Census of 2002 and the one in 2012. So, where were these new Black farmers? 

Turns out, they're mostly in East Texas. The R code in this repo shows how we went about mapping that. You can see the published map here:

I'm sharing this process so others can check my work and build on it.
